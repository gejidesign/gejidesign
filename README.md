TO FULLY UNDERSTAND FREE WILL THROUGH GENUINE PERSONALITY BY METHODICAL CREATION.
Trust your instinct, imagination, and if-then* principles. The time put in will 
reflect from draft to final. Keep in mind these foundational practices. No matter
the medium, your best work will prove worthy if your design portfolio is treated 
with the respect you owe it. You are challenged to never let mistakes along the 
plain leave you feeling low and unmotivated. These are natural characteristics of
editing. 

There are many examples of expression when it boils down to medium, format, and 
style. Browse the gejiDESIGN "Easel of Contents". Every example listed is available
to guide you and your work from start to finish. Feel justified in putting your own 
twist too! Art has no tethers. Consider the gravity of crude and/or dirogotory messages
for the betterment of others. Not to mention yourself. 

Without further ado, go get it! Be it! It will be forever a part of you that all of us 
can marvel about!
